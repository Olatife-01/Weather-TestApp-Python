Objective: 
Build a Python web app to retrieve and display weather conditions for various cities using Flask, and deploy it on Render cloud and Azure web app.

Requirements:
Postman
Git & GitHub
OpenWeather API
Render Cloud
Azure Web App

Challenges: I struggled to understand wh, my Weather.py was running fine in the terminal, but Mainserver.py was not pulling the weather conditions of other countries. It took me over 3 hours of troubleshooting to realize that one of the dependent Python-env modules was somehow missing in the requirements.
Thank you to all the many Youtube creators, y'all save lives 👏 🤣 

Lessons & Observations:
>Thoroughly check dependencies and environment configurations.
>Utilizing virtual environments is crucial for managing dependencies.
>Effective debugging requires patience and methodical troubleshooting.

Although Dev is definitely not for me, it was an interesting experience.

Side Note: I had gotten too used to the Azure unlimited Non-Production sub at work, this time i forgot to turn off the WebApp in my azure free sub, and woke up to a used up free sub ($100+ in one night) 🤣 🤣
